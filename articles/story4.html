        <hr />
        <p>DONDO, Mozambique – After Cyclone Idai tore through her village in Mozambique, destroying scores of homes, Francesca
        Raoul and her daughter sought shelter in one of the few structures left standing: the local high school.</p>
        
        <p>The 26-year-old mother and her daughter are now among more than 200 families who have found shelter in the school in
        Dondo, a small town 30 kilometres inland from the coastal city of Beira.
        
        Together with 10 to 20 other families – all of whom lost their homes and most of their possessions to the storm – they
        squeeze into a classroom at night, sleeping side by side. Francesca is in desperate need of the most basic necessities
        to restart life.</p>
        
        <p>“I hope for a tent because I don’t feel safe sleeping in a group,” she said. “I lost my kitchen too so some food would
        be good, but I need to cook it.”</p>
        
        <p>Others share her plight. Mikirina Perez, 27, a single mother of four, described how little has been available since the
        storm ripped through the community on the night of 14–15 March. She too sleeps in the school with her children.</p>

        <p>“I have only received one cup of maize flour a day for my family,” she explained as she looked at her two-year-old boy,
        whose belly looked distended in an ominous sign of malnutrition.</p>
        
    <p> Mikirina and Francesca joined other women earlier that morning to put their names down on a distribution list for relief
        items. However, they missed out as there were too many families and too few items to distribute.
        
        “It’s very upsetting because things are getting harder as each day passes,” said Francesca.</p>

    <p> When the cyclone churned through the area, it destroyed tens of thousands of homes and floods spoiled most food
        reserves. Prices of whatever little remained in the markets have spiraled beyond reach.
        
        The traumatic events of the night the cyclone hit are still fresh.
        
        Ginoka Phillipa, 30, described the sound of the wind as it grew stronger until it blew the roof of her house off.</p>
        
    <p> “I fled with my husband and two boys to a neighbour’s house,” she explains. “But when I returned, all the walls had
        collapsed.”
        
        She was able to collect a few kitchen pots, some food items and some wet clothes and made her way to the high school
        which now provides temporary shelter.</p>
