        <hr />
    <p>“The horrifying fact that nearly one in five children in South Sudan has been forced to flee their home illustrates how
    devastating this conflict has been for the country’s most vulnerable,” said Leila Pakkala, UNICEF’s Regional Director
    for Eastern and Southern Africa. “Add this to the more than one million children who are also displaced within South
    Sudan, and the future of a generation is truly on the brink.”</p>
    
    <p>Children make 62 per cent of more than 1.8 million refugees from South Sudan, according to the latest UN figures. Most
    have arrived in Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Sudan.</p>
    
    <p>“No refugee crisis today worries me more than South Sudan,” said Valentin Tapsoba, UNHCR’s Africa Bureau Director. “That
    refugee children are becoming the defining face of this emergency is incredibly troubling. We, all in the humanitarian
    community, need most urgent, committed and sustainable support to be able to save their lives.”</p>
    
    <p>Inside South Sudan, more than one thousand children have been killed or injured since the conflict first erupted in
    2013, while an estimated 1.14 million children have been internally displaced.</p>
    
    <p>Nearly three quarters of the country's children are out of school -- the highest proportion of out-of-school children in
    the world.</p>
