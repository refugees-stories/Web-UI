        <hr />
        <p>CÚCUTA, Colombia – Venezuelan Jose Luis Jimenez already risked bandits and armed groups to slip across the border to
        Colombia in a desperate hunt for food for his family – but this week that crossing got even more dangerous.</p>
        
    <p> With the border bridge shut, he joined thousands of Venezuelans fording the torrential waters of a border river in full
        spate, to seek urgent help in this border city.</p>
        
        At a communal kitchen supported by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and run by the local Catholic Church diocese, he was
        among thousands of hungry Venezuelans lining up for a hot meal.</p>
        
        <p>“I am very grateful to UNHCR and the Diocese,” said the wiry 48-year-old with a weather-beaten face. “I rely on this
        service to feed myself and my children and I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have it.”
    Amid spiraling hyperinflation, shortages, political turmoil, violence and persecution, more than 2.7 million Venezuelans
    have left the country as refugees or migrants since 2015 to seek safety or a better life abroad.</p>
    
    <p>The kitchen, aptly named La Divina Providencia, or Divine Providence, serves up to 8,000 meals a day and is a lifeline
    to Venezuelan refugees and migrants transiting through Cúcuta but also to people like Jose Luis who continue to live in
    Venezuela but cross the border to Colombia every day. Showers, medical consulations, and legal aid are also available
    there.</p>
    
    <p>To earn a few Colombian pesos, he carries heavy loads for other Venezuelans who travel to Cúcuta to buy food, medicines
    or other goods that are scarce or impossible to find in their country.</p>
