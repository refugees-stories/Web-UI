        <hr />
        <p>Forced to leave their homes for unfamiliar communities, refugees often struggle to secure very basic survival
        necessities. But with a unique knowledge of the culture and language from which they were uprooted, displaced Syrian
        citizens have found support — and employment — by teaching others their native language.</p>
        
        <p> Life of a refugee
        
        Moulham Ibrik is an atypical master's student.
        
        He's pursuing degrees in prosthetics engineering and intercultural business communications at universities in France and
        Slovenia. He sleeps between two and six hours each night, and takes French lessons in addition to his college studies.
        He is separated from family and friends forced to flee their homes because of the five-year-old Syrian civil war.</p>
        
        <p>Ibrik is one of the almost five million Syrian refugees displaced by war. After leaving Syria in February 2015 as
        violence and extremism ravaged his country, he spent eight months in Turkey, home to almost two million refugees.
        
        <p>Ibrik, 27, now lives in Paris, and tutors Arabic to students around the world in his spare time. As a conversation
        partner on NaTakallam, an online platform that matches Arabic speakers and learners to Syrian refugees, Ibrik is
        teaching more than conversation skills.</p>
        
        <p>NaTakallam is not a traditional online learning platform. Conversation partners aren't certified instructors working off
        structured syllabi — they're Syrian refugees making a small income by talking to people who want to learn or practice
        Arabic. Sometimes they go weeks without a reliable Internet connection or place to live and work.</p>
        
        <p>Designed for students who already know some Arabic or are supplementing traditional Arabic classes with a native speaker
        through NaTakallam, students practice Levantine, a spoken Arabic dialect. Conversation partners speak French or English
        in addition to Arabic. Some conversation partners are willing to work with beginners, too.</p>
        
        <p>My teacher, a refugee also living in France, tended to her young child while chatting with me on Skype. The cacophony of
        cartoons and crying echoed in the virtual classroom, interspersed between lessons on the Arabic words for "want" and
        "have." She declined to be interviewed for this story, but our 30-minute session did not just focus on pronouns and
        conjugation. I asked about her day, her husband, and her children. She asked me about San Francisco and what it's like
        to be a writer.</p>
