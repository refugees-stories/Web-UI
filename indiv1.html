            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a User Experience (UX) Design student at Lambda School in the
              Seattle area. Before studying UX, I have been a stay-at-home-mom to two kids for
              8 years and prior to that I was a mental health counselor for 4 years. My strong
              psychology background has shown me the importance of empathy, understanding others,
              problem solving, and learning from our failures in UX. I believe failing is an
              integral part to developing a design that is usable and desirable, as long as we
              learn from our mistakes, ask users the right questions, and create designs that meet
              their needs. Ultimately, my desire is to create experiences that are not simply
              enjoyable and intuitive, but also create meaning and connection in people's lives.
              Our world is vastly complicated. I want to bring us all closer together, in common
              causes, to do great things.</p>

          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>I am a User Experience (UX) Design student at Lambda School in the
            Seattle area.UX refers to the user experience, which focuses on how something works
            and how people interact with it.</p>

          <p>Designers also research targeted users to develop a clear understanding of their
            needs, define interaction models, design wireframes, build prototypes and work on
            brand color. And they conduct user testing and review metrics and focus-group
            reactions so they’re able to make the necessary tweaks to enhance the product.</p>

          <p>The ability to solve problems as well as empathize with the user to understand what
            he needs is also important. “A mediocre UX designer will think about how the user
            acts,” says Cogswell. “An adequate UX designer will focus on how the user thinks.
            But a truly great UX designer will focus on how the user feels.”</p>
