            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Erika is a lambda school student completing the Full-Stack
              Web Developer track. With some college background in Computer Science, she is able to
              learn web technologies and develop code for websites, such as the page you are on now.

          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>My role is UI Web developer. UI Developer stands for User Interface Design, a technology-focused role that
            seeks
            to create digital software that entices the user into a seamless interaction between
            human and computer. </p>

          <p>The UI Developer is, first and foremost, a technical, scientific, computer geek. But
            like a lot of roles in computing that focus on the consumer experience, the role
            seeks to please human beings by understanding how computers are used and how the
            experience could be streamlined to create a better end result. This requires some analytical
            thought processes.
          </p>

          <p>The UI Developer is a Graphic Designer and a people pleaser. Their designs are
            practical and focused on engaging the user of an app or website or program.
            Crossover UI Developer skills include industrial design, web site design or
            software design.</p>
