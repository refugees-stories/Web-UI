            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Nolan is a lambda school student currently in the Full-stack
              web development program.

          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>Nolan's role is in back-end architecture.
            The back-end is the code that runs on the server, that receives requests
            from the clients, and contains the logic to send the appropriate data back to
            the client. The back-end also includes the database, which will persistently
            store all of the data for the application. This article focuses on the hardware
            and software on the server-side that make this possible.</p>

          <p>

            The back-end is all of the technology required to process the incoming request and
            generate and send the response to the client. This typically includes three major parts:
            The server. This is the computer that receives requests.
            The app. This is the application running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from
            the database, and sends a response.
            The database. Databases are used to organize and persist data.
