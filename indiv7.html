            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Duraan Ali has an extensive experience in working with non-profit organizations.
              He worked for international NGO for over 7 years, working as a regional manager
              and a supervisor. He also has first hand experience in helping refugees in parts
              of Africa.</p>

          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>Ali's role is as a UI developer. Ali worked on several parts of the project including the homepage, the
            refugee
            stories, submit and signin pages. He also worked on the general mobile responsiveness
            of the website, making it easy for people viewing from mobile to see all the content</p>

          <p>The UI Developer is, first and foremost, a technical, scientific, computer geek. But
            like a lot of roles in computing that focus on the consumer experience, the role
            seeks to please human beings by understanding how computers are used and how the
            experience could be streamlined to create a better end result. This requires some analytical
            thought processes.</p>
